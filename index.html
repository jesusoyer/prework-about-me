      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p> I am a west texas native who recently moved to Austin, TX. I never thought about beginning a journey to become a software engineer. Mostly because living in west texas my entire life it really wasn't an option. However, in the past year I have been exposed to coding and want to learn more and more. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p> I am from Stanton, TX. For those who don't know where that is located (which is usually everyone). It is a small town 15 miles away from Midland, TX. Im from ther permian basin the big oil area.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> My hobbies are dancing, video games, hiking, and I love playin board games/trading card games.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I have just got into coding about 6 months ago. Before that my dream job was to become an attorney. Realizing that wasn't realistic I was searching for other avenues. I watched webinars on multiple sites about promising careers but couldn't find what suited me best. My girlfriend who is a petroleum engineer asked if I had ever considered programming. So I looked into it and found that it was fun and challenging. I dove a littler deeper into it and realized it is something that I wish I had found sooner, because I love it. My dream changed from wanting to become and attorney to wanting to program for a tech company. My goal is to work for a tech company because if I can just achieve that first goal or dream I can go beyond it and grow my skills.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Austin, TX.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to make life easier. I want to create programs that can help everyone and all walks of life. </p>
